My heart burns with an eternal flame for you!
You are the sun, the moon, and every star that ever shone!
I am hopelessly, wildly, gloriously in love with you!
Your name is etched upon the walls of my soul!
You have bewitched me, body and soul!
I would cross oceans of fire just to see you smile!
Every breath I take is a love letter to you!
You are my destiny, my downfall, my everything!
Without you, even the stars seem dim and lifeless!
My love for you defies time, space, and all reason!
